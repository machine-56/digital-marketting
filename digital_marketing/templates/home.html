      <h2>How Digital Marketing Works</h2>
      <p>Digital marketing is a multi-channel approach that combines <b>data-driven insights</b>, <b>targeted content</b>, and <b>technology</b> to reach and convert potential customers. It works through a cycle of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Targeting:</strong> Identify the right audience based on demographics, interests, and online behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Create compelling content that resonates with the audience across multiple touchpoints—websites, emails, ads, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Use analytics to monitor results, tweak strategies in real-time, and maximize ROI.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Compared to traditional methods like TV or print, digital marketing provides <b>real-time feedback</b>, allows <b>budget flexibility</b>, and ensures that every dollar spent is accountable through detailed reporting.</p>

    <div class="social-media-advantage">
      <h2>Social Media: The Power of Connection</h2>
      <p>Social media platforms have transformed the way brands and consumers interact. Here's why they outshine traditional marketing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Two-Way Communication:</strong> Engage directly with your audience through comments, messages, and shares—building trust and community.</li>
        <li><strong>Hyper-Targeted Ads:</strong> Reach specific groups based on location, age, interests, and behavior—ensuring your message lands where it matters most.</li>
        <li><strong>Viral Potential:</strong> Leverage the power of shares, likes, and trends to amplify your brand's reach far beyond paid campaigns.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Adaptability:</strong> Launch campaigns quickly and adjust on the fly based on audience response—something traditional marketing can't match.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whether you're a small business or a global brand, social media provides a platform to <b>humanize your brand</b>, tell your story, and drive meaningful engagement that translates into real business results.</p>
